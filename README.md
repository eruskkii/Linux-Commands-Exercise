# Linux-Commands-Exercise
First exercise on Linux commands = These are some of the commands I can remember. 

I am learning Linux for some reason

List of Linux terminal commands I've learnt so far

pwd - Print working Directory - Shows the folder you're currently in

touch - creates a new file

cat - reads the content of that file

ls - Lists out content of the directory you are

info - displays information about a particular command
man - opens  a manual about terminal commands - Similar to info

mkdir - Create a folder - mkdir <folder_name/> - to create a folder name inside another folder

rmdir - remove directory

rm - Can help us delete files and folders with content (Recursive deleting) using the -r flag

cd - change the current folder you're working in

cd- = Takes you back to the previous folder you were working in.

which - Shows where a command is stored inside the linux system

cp - Copy files

mv - Move or rename (rename is done with writing the the file path with old name and writing the file path with new name in front

echo - To return anything you gave it

variables - Assigning values to any word. e.g Name=Emmanuel. Where Name is the variable and Emmanuel is the value of that variable. Please note that there must be no space.

echo + variables = Echo is used to find the value of a variable = echo $<variable> i.e echo $Name

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Flags - Used to extend the functionality of a particular command. You can check for them using the Man command
    ls -l = Displays more inforation about directory content
    ls -a = Shows hidden folders starting with .
    ls -la = combines the above
    rm -r = Deletes folders recursively
